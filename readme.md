Codewars is a fun site to improve coding and algorithm skills.

The problems are ranked by kyu with 8 kyu being the easiest and 1 kyu being the hardest.

Codewars is great because after solving the problem, you vote for both the best solution and the most clever solution.  Being able to look at the best solutions after solving the problems I have found to be an incredible and fun way to learn.  

Included in this repository are the toughest problems I have solved so far along with some interesting easier ones.
